# Introduction
Multi Dimensional Money Streaming Vaults, Escrows and Yields on Bitcoin Cash Protocol 

# Context
In “Streaming Money,” Andreas guides the audience through a future where money acquires a new time dimension. Do you struggle with the temptation to go on spending sprees? What if you could render your money unspendable for a period of time? In the last episode, “Forkology,” he talked about what happens when there are rifts in consensus. Now he explores the implications of existing scripting capabilities in Bitcoin, and how those capabilities will expand even further with a second-layer protocol called the Lightning Network — more than a year before it would even go live on testnet in 2017!
